# Backlog

Tracking potential improvements beyond the CS320 requirements.
We move items here once they no longer fit inside the README so the project
landing page stays focused.

## Deferred Decisions
- UI component library selection for the new UI (e.g., utility CSS + custom components vs. lightweight kit).
- OAuth2/SSO upgrade path beyond initial JWT/basic auth.
- WAF/API gateway selection for production deployment.
- Secrets management tooling for prod (vault/secret manager implementation details).

## Reporting & Observability
- Future observability enhancements (distributed tracing backends, log shipping) to be considered post-MVP.
