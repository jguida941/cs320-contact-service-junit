## Goals

- Turn the contact/task/appointment library into a user-facing application.
- Deliver a web UI for CRUD, search/filter, and validation feedback.
- Keep existing domain rules/tests intact while adding persistence, API, and deployment story.

---

## Current State

- **Phase 1 complete**: Spring Boot scaffold implemented.
- Spring Boot 3.4.12 Maven project with layered packages (`domain`, `service`, `api`, `persistence`).
- Domain classes (`Contact`, `Task`, `Appointment`) with validation rules preserved.
- Services annotated with `@Service` for Spring DI while retaining `getInstance()` for backward compatibility.
- Health/info actuator endpoints available; other actuator endpoints locked down.
- Latest CI: All tests passing, 100% mutation score, 100% line coverage, SpotBugs clean.
- Data is still volatile (ConcurrentHashMap only); no database, migrations, or persistence abstraction yet (Phase 3).
- `ui/qa-dashboard` is a sample Vite/React metrics console, not a product UI.
- No authentication, authorization, REST controllers, centralized error handling, logging, or observability yet.
- `getDatabase()` methods return defensive copies; safe to surface over APIs.

---

## Architecture Direction

- **Backend**: Spring Boot REST service layered as controller → application/service → domain → persistence; keep domain validation as the single source of truth.
- **Persistence**: JPA/Hibernate with Flyway migrations; Postgres in prod, H2/Testcontainers for tests.
- **API contract**: JSON REST with request/response DTOs, Bean Validation, and OpenAPI/Swagger UI for consumers.
- **Frontend**: React + Vite SPA (TypeScript) in `ui/app` (separate from QA dashboard) with router, form validation, and API client abstraction.
- **Security**: JWT auth, CORS policy for the SPA, input/output sanitization, security headers, and rate limiting in front of the API.
- **Packaging**: Dockerfile + docker-compose for app + DB; CI builds/publishes images and runs integration/E2E suites.

## Phased Work Plan

### Implementation Order
```
0 → 1 → 2 → 2.5 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 5.5 → 6 → 7 → (CI: 8 → 9 → 10)
```

### Phase 0: Pre-API Fixes ✅ (Completed)
Fixes implemented:
- Mutable state leakage in `TaskService.getDatabase()` and `ContactService.getDatabase()`:
  - Previously `Map.copyOf()` made the map unmodifiable but contained Task/Contact objects were still mutable.
  - Now returns defensive copies via `copy()` methods (matching `AppointmentService` pattern).
- Date validation edge case in `Validation.validateDateNotPast()`:
  - Previously used `date.before(new Date())` which was millisecond-sensitive.
  - Now accepts equality (date equal to "now" is valid) to avoid boundary flakiness.
- Added `copy()` methods to Task and Contact classes.
- Added tests verifying defensive copy behavior.
- All existing tests pass.

### Phase 1: Backend scaffold ✅ (Completed)
Implementation details:
- Added Spring Boot 3.4.12 parent POM with starter-web, actuator, and validation dependencies.
- Created `Application.java` Spring Boot entrypoint with `@SpringBootApplication`.
- Reorganized packages into layered architecture:
  - `contactapp.domain` - Domain entities (Contact, Task, Appointment, Validation)
  - `contactapp.service` - Services with @Service annotations (ContactService, TaskService, AppointmentService)
  - `contactapp.api` - REST controllers (empty, Phase 2)
  - `contactapp.persistence` - Repository interfaces (empty, Phase 3)
- Added `@Service` annotations while preserving `getInstance()` for backward compatibility.
- Created `application.yml` with profile-based configuration (dev/test/prod).
- Locked down actuator endpoints to health/info only per OWASP guidelines.
- Added Spring Boot smoke tests:
  - `ApplicationTest` - Context load verification
  - `ActuatorEndpointsTest` - Endpoint security verification (health/info exposed, others blocked)
  - `ServiceBeanTest` - Bean presence and singleton verification
- All tests pass, 100% mutation score maintained.
- See ADR-0020 for architectural decisions.

### Phase 2: API + DTOs
- Add REST controllers for contacts, tasks, and appointments with request/response DTOs and Bean Validation.
- Introduce mapping layer (manual or MapStruct) to decouple transport from domain.
- Add global exception handler returning consistent error payloads; publish OpenAPI/Swagger UI.
- Note: Controller examples assume in-memory services; adapt to DB-backed IDs/UUIDs when persistence lands.

### Phase 2.5: API Security Testing Foundation
- Generate OpenAPI automatically from controllers (`springdoc-openapi`) with `/api/v1` prefix.
- Add API fuzzing (Schemathesis/RESTler) in CI against the OpenAPI spec; fail on 5xx or schema violations.
- Prepare ZAP-compatible artifacts for later DAST runs.

### Phase 3: Persistence
- Add JPA entities/repositories and replace in-memory maps with persistence-backed services.
- Add Flyway migrations; configure Postgres for dev/prod and H2/Testcontainers for tests.
- Write integration tests (MockMvc/WebTestClient + Testcontainers) covering API and repository flows.

### Phase 4: UI
- Scaffold `ui/app` (React + TypeScript) with routing for Contacts/Tasks/Appointments.
- Build list + filter/sort views; create/edit forms with inline validation; delete confirmations; optimistic updates.
- Add API client wrapper (env-based base URL), loading/error states, and component + E2E smoke tests (Vitest/RTL + Playwright/Cypress).

### Phase 5: Security + Observability
- Add JWT auth with Spring Security, `@PreAuthorize` for role-based method security, and CORS for the SPA.
- Add structured logging, tracing, and metrics (Micrometer/Actuator + Prometheus); propagate correlation IDs.
- Add security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options).
- Add rate limiting or gateway throttles if exposed publicly.
- Document secrets strategy: env vars for dev; vault/secret manager for prod.

### Phase 5.5: DAST + Runtime Security
- Run OWASP ZAP (API/baseline) in CI against the running test instance; fail on high/critical findings.
- Add auth/role integration tests (401/403 assertions) for protected endpoints.

### Phase 6: Packaging + CI
- Add Dockerfiles for backend and UI; compose file for app + Postgres (+ pgAdmin optional).
- Provide Makefile/task runner for local dev; publish images in CI.
- Extend CI to run unit + integration + UI tests, then build/push images while keeping existing quality gates.

### Phase 7: UX polish and backlog
- Add search/pagination/sorting for large datasets; empty states, toasts, and responsive layout.
- Harden accessibility; instrument feature usage and errors for future iterations.

### CI/CD Security Stages (Phases 8-10)
> See `docs/ci-cd/ci_cd_plan.md` for details. These align with implementation phases:
> - CI Phase 8 (ZAP) → Implementation Phase 5.5
> - CI Phase 9 (API fuzzing) → Implementation Phase 2.5
> - CI Phase 10 (auth tests) → Implementation Phase 5.5

## Detailed Requirements

### Backend / API
- Provide a Spring Boot runtime with a main entrypoint.
- Expose JSON REST endpoints for Contact, Task, and Appointment:
  - CRUD operations (list, get by id, create, update, delete).
  - Request/response DTOs with Bean Validation; map to domain objects.
  - Consistent JSON error envelope (e.g., `{ "message": "..." }`) for validation failures.
- Include health/info endpoints.

### Persistence
- Use Postgres for dev/prod data; use H2 and/or Postgres Testcontainers for automated tests.
- Model JPA entities aligned to Contact/Task/Appointment and wire services to repositories.
- Manage schema with Flyway migrations; keep environment-specific profiles (dev/test/prod).

### Frontend UI
- Create a React + Vite + TypeScript app under `ui/app`.
- Provide pages for Contact, Task, and Appointment:
  - List with basic filtering/sorting.
  - Create/edit forms with inline validation messages.
  - Delete confirmation flow.
- Show loading and error states; handle API error messages.
- Responsive layout suitable for desktop and mobile widths.
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching and caching (per ADR-0017).

### Security
- Add authentication (JWT per ADR-0018) and protect mutating endpoints.
- Enforce role-based authorization for create/update/delete with `@PreAuthorize`.
- Configure CORS for the SPA origin and apply standard security headers.
- Apply security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options).
- Define secrets management strategy (env vars for dev; vault/secret manager for prod).

### Observability
- Add structured logging with request correlation IDs.
- Expose metrics/tracing via Spring Actuator (Micrometer) for HTTP and database calls.

### Packaging / DevOps
- Provide Dockerfiles for backend and UI; docker-compose for app + Postgres (+ optional pgAdmin).
- Externalize configuration via environment variables; document sample `.env` for local use.
- CI should run unit + integration + UI tests, build artifacts/images, and publish OpenAPI/UI outputs.

### Security Testing
- Add API fuzzing (Schemathesis or RESTler) against the OpenAPI spec; fail CI on 5xx or schema violations.
- Add DAST (OWASP ZAP baseline/API scan) in CI against a running test instance; fail on high/critical findings.
- Add auth/role integration tests asserting 401/403 for protected endpoints and success for allowed roles.
- Keep security scans documented and repeatable in CI.

### Quality / Testing
- Keep existing unit tests for domain/services.
- Add controller tests for REST endpoints and integration tests with Testcontainers.
- Add UI component tests (Vitest/RTL) and at least a smoke E2E flow (Playwright/Cypress).
- Maintain JaCoCo ≥ 80% coverage gate and keep mutation/static analysis gates in the pipeline.
- Spring Boot tests use Mockito's subclass mock-maker (`src/test/resources/mockito-extensions/org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker`) to avoid agent attach issues on newer JDKs while still enabling MockMvc/context testing.

## Code Examples

### Spring Boot Entrypoint (Phase 1)
```java
// src/main/java/contactapp/Application.java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

### REST Controller + DTOs (Phase 2)
```java
// src/main/java/contactapp/api/ContactController.java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/contacts")
public class ContactController {
    private final ContactService service;
    public ContactController(ContactService service) { this.service = service; }

    @PostMapping
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    public ContactResponse create(@RequestBody @Valid ContactRequest req) {
        var contact = new Contact(req.id(), req.firstName(), req.lastName(), req.phone(), req.address());
        service.addContact(contact);
        return ContactResponse.from(contact);
    }
}

// DTOs (records keep it terse)
public record ContactRequest(String id, String firstName, String lastName, String phone, String address) {}
public record ContactResponse(String id, String firstName, String lastName, String phone, String address) {
    static ContactResponse from(Contact c) {
        return new ContactResponse(c.getContactId(), c.getFirstName(), c.getLastName(), c.getPhone(), c.getAddress());
    }
}

// Global error handler
@ControllerAdvice
class GlobalErrors {
    @ExceptionHandler(IllegalArgumentException.class)
    ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>> badRequest(IllegalArgumentException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(Map.of("message", ex.getMessage()));
    }
}
```

### API Client + TanStack Query (Phase 4)
```ts
// ui/app/src/api.ts — low-level fetch helpers
const base = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL ?? "http://localhost:8080/api/v1";

export async function fetchContacts(): Promise<ContactResponse[]> {
  const res = await fetch(`${base}/contacts`);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error((await res.json()).message ?? "Request failed");
  return res.json();
}

export async function createContact(payload: ContactRequest): Promise<ContactResponse> {
  const res = await fetch(`${base}/contacts`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error((await res.json()).message ?? "Request failed");
  return res.json();
}
```

```ts
// ui/app/src/hooks/useContacts.ts — TanStack Query wrappers (per ADR-0017)
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { fetchContacts, createContact } from "../api";

export function useContacts() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["contacts"],
    queryFn: fetchContacts,
  });
}

export function useCreateContact() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: createContact,
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["contacts"] });
    },
  });
}
```
