# Demo Cheat Sheet

Quick reference for showcasing the project to recruiters.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start everything (backend + frontend)
python scripts/dev_stack.py

# Access points:
# - API: http://localhost:8080
# - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
# - React UI: http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Show Quality Reports

```bash
# Run full build with all quality gates
mvn verify

# View coverage report (90%+ coverage)
open target/site/jacoco/index.html

# View mutation report (84% mutation score)
open target/pit-reports/index.html

# View SpotBugs report
open target/spotbugs.html

# Launch QA Dashboard (React app)
python scripts/serve_quality_dashboard.py
```

---

## Show Testing

```bash
# Run all unit tests (930+ tests)
mvn test

# Run integration tests with real PostgreSQL
mvn verify -DskipITs=false

# Run mutation testing (proves test effectiveness)
mvn pitest:mutationCoverage

# Run API fuzzing (30,000+ generated requests)
python scripts/api_fuzzing.py --start-app
```

---

## Show Security Features

```bash
# 1. Rate Limiting Demo (login endpoint: 5 req/min)
for i in {1..7}; do
  echo "Attempt $i:"
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
    -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"test","password":"test"}'
done
# First 5: 401 (bad credentials)
# 6-7: 429 (rate limited)

# 2. JWT Cookie Demo
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"demo","password":"demo123"}'
cat cookies.txt  # Shows httpOnly auth_token

# 3. CSRF Token Demo
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/auth/csrf-token | jq
```

---

## Show Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and start full stack
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Access pgAdmin (admin@contactapp.local / admin)
open http://localhost:5050

# Cleanup
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## Show CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

```bash
# Push to trigger pipeline
git push origin main

# Watch in browser:
# 1. GitHub repo → Actions tab
# 2. Shows matrix: Ubuntu/Windows × Java 17/21
# 3. Quality gates: JaCoCo, PITest, SpotBugs, Checkstyle
# 4. API fuzzing workflow runs after
```

## Talking Points

### "What makes this project enterprise-grade?"

1. **Layered Architecture** - Clear separation between API, Service, Domain, Persistence
2. **Two-Layer Validation** - Bean validation at API, constructor validation in domain
3. **Mutation Testing** - Proves tests catch bugs, not just execute code
4. **Multi-tenant Security** - Per-user data isolation, JWT in httpOnly cookies
5. **49 ADRs** - Every major decision documented with rationale
6. **7 Quality Gates** - Enforced in CI, no exceptions

### "What security measures are implemented?"

1. JWT tokens in HttpOnly cookies (prevents XSS token theft)
2. BCrypt password hashing
3. Rate limiting (Bucket4j) - login, register, API
4. CSRF protection with Spring Security 7 SPA pattern
5. CSP headers, X-Frame-Options, etc.
6. OWASP Dependency-Check in CI
7. PII masking in logs

### "How do you ensure code quality?"

1. 90% line coverage (JaCoCo, 80% enforced)
2. 84% mutation score (PITest, 70% enforced)
3. SpotBugs static analysis (zero findings)
4. Checkstyle (zero violations)
5. API fuzzing with 30,000+ requests
6. Matrix CI (2 OS × 2 Java versions)
