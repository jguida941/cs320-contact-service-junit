# ChatGPT Audit Log

This document tracks a sequential review of repository content. Each entry logs
the file/section examined (approximately 100-line chunks when practical), the
checks performed, and any findings or required follow-ups.

| Timestamp (ET) | File / Section | Checks Performed | Findings / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-12-01 11:02 | README.md (lines 1-120) | Verified badges/links exist, stack/version descriptions match pom (Spring Boot 3.4.12), dev instructions reference current scripts. Confirmed stated test counts (571/577) align with latest `rg` sum; security highlights consistent with implemented features. | ✅ Accurate; no doc drift observed for this section. |

_Log continues as additional files/sections are reviewed._
