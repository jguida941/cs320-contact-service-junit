## Goals

- Turn the contact/task/appointment library into a user-facing application.
- Deliver a web UI for CRUD, search/filter, and validation feedback.
- Keep existing domain rules/tests intact while adding persistence, API, and deployment story.

---

## Current State

- **Phases 0-7 complete**: Spring Boot 4.0.0 foundation with layered packages, REST API with OpenAPI/Swagger, Spring Data JPA persistence (Postgres/H2/Testcontainers), React 19 SPA with search/pagination/sorting/admin dashboard/accessibility, JWT authentication with per-user data isolation, rate limiting, CSRF protection, structured logging with PII masking, Prometheus metrics, Docker packaging with CI/CD, and comprehensive security testing (ZAP DAST, Schemathesis API fuzzing).
- **Project/Task Tracker Evolution implemented (ADR-0045 Phases 1-5)**: Complete implementation of project organization and team collaboration features:
  - Phase 1: Project entity with full CRUD operations, status tracking (ACTIVE/ON_HOLD/COMPLETED/ARCHIVED), migration V7
  - Phase 2: Task enhancements with status (TODO/IN_PROGRESS/DONE), dueDate, timestamps, migration V8
  - Phase 3: Task-project linking with projectId FK, migration V10
  - Phase 4: Appointment linking with taskId/projectId FKs, migration V11
  - Phase 5: Task assignment with assigneeId FK, migration V12
- Spring Boot 4.0.0 Maven project with layered packages (`domain`, `service`, `api`, `persistence`, `security`, `config`).
- Domain classes (`Contact`, `Task`, `Appointment`) with validation rules preserved; `appointmentDate` serialized as ISO 8601 with millis + offset (`yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX`, UTC).
- `Validation.java` centralizes shared guards via `validateTrimmedLength(...)` / `validateTrimmedLengthAllowBlank(...)` (trim + length enforcement for Contact/Task/Project fields) and LocalDate helpers (`validateDateNotPast(LocalDate, ...)`, `validateOptionalDateNotPast(...)`) so Task `dueDate` now rejects past dates in constructors, setters, and updates without duplicating logic.
- Services annotated with `@Service` for Spring DI while retaining `getInstance()` fallbacks powered by in-memory stores that migrate into the JPA-backed stores once Spring initializes; `getInstance()` now simply returns the Spring proxy when available so no manual proxy unwrapping is needed, and the backlog tracks their eventual removal once DI-only usage is confirmed. Service + legacy tests that mutate the singleton are annotated with JUnit’s `@Isolated` so Surefire does not run them concurrently and corrupt the shared static stores.
- REST controllers expose CRUD at `/api/v1/contacts`, `/api/v1/tasks`, `/api/v1/appointments` plus `/api/auth` for login/register/logout; controllers validate input via Bean Validation DTOs and rely on domain constructors for business rules.
- DTOs with Bean Validation (`@NotBlank`, `@Size`, `@Pattern`, `@FutureOrPresent`) mapped to domain objects.
- Global exception handler (`GlobalExceptionHandler`) maps exceptions to JSON error responses (400, 401, 403, 404, 409 including optimistic locking conflicts).
- Custom error controller (`CustomErrorController`) ensures ALL errors return JSON, including container-level errors, and `RequestLoggingFilter` logs masked IP/query data + user agents whenever request logging is enabled.
- Persistence implemented via Spring Data repositories + mapper components; schema managed by Flyway migrations targeting Postgres (dev/prod) and H2/Testcontainers (tests). The default (no profile) run uses in-memory H2 in PostgreSQL compatibility mode so `mvn spring-boot:run` works out of the box; `dev`/`integration`/`prod` profiles point at Postgres. Shared migrations now live under `db/migration/common`, with profile-specific overrides under `db/migration/h2` and `db/migration/postgresql`.
- Testcontainers-based integration suites cover Contact/Task/Appointment services against real Postgres, while new JWT/config/filter/unit tests push total coverage to 949 tests.
- Mapper/unit suites now include null-guard coverage plus JPA entity accessor tests to keep persistence mutation-safe even when Hibernate instantiates proxies through the protected constructors.
- OpenAPI/Swagger UI available at `/swagger-ui.html` and `/v3/api-docs` (springdoc-openapi).
- Health/info actuator endpoints available; other actuator endpoints locked down.
- Latest CI: 1,026 tests passing (unit + slice + Testcontainers + security + filter + config + Project/Task/Appointment enhancement tests), 94% mutation score, 96%+ line coverage on stores, 95%+ on mappers, SpotBugs clean.
- Testcontainers-backed Postgres integration tests run automatically in CI (Ubuntu jobs pass `-DskipITs=false`) while local `mvn verify` runs set `skipITs=true` by default; enable them locally with `mvn verify -DskipITs=false` once Docker Desktop/Colima is running.
- Controller tests (71 tests): ContactControllerTest (30), TaskControllerTest (21), AppointmentControllerTest (20).
- Exception handler tests (5 tests): GlobalExceptionHandlerTest validates direct handler coverage (including ConstraintViolationException for path variable validation).
- Error controller tests (34 tests): CustomErrorControllerTest (17) + JsonErrorReportValveTest (17) validate container-level error handling.
- Service tests include lookup method coverage: getAllContacts/getContactById, getAllTasks/getTaskById, getAllAppointments/getAppointmentById, plus mapper/repository slices and legacy singleton tests.
- `ui/qa-dashboard` is a sample Vite/React metrics console, not a product UI.
- JWT cookies (`auth_token`) default to 30-minute expirations, use a dedicated `app.auth.cookie.secure` property (env: `APP_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE`) so prod deployments must explicitly enable the Secure flag, and the SPA issues `credentials: 'include'` fetches—edge proxies + Spring `CorsRegistry` must list concrete origins with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.
- Controllers use service-level lookup methods (`getAllXxx()`, `getXxxById()`) instead of `getDatabase()` for better encapsulation.
- DTO constraints use static imports from `Validation.MAX_*` constants to stay in sync with domain rules.

---

## Architecture Direction

- **Backend**: Spring Boot REST service layered as controller → application/service → domain → persistence; keep domain validation as the single source of truth.
- **Persistence**: JPA/Hibernate with Flyway migrations; Postgres in prod, H2/Testcontainers for tests.
- **API contract**: JSON REST with request/response DTOs, Bean Validation, and OpenAPI/Swagger UI for consumers.
- **Frontend**: React + Vite SPA (TypeScript) in `ui/contact-app` (separate from QA dashboard) with router, form validation, and API client abstraction.
- **Security**: JWT auth, CORS policy for the SPA, input/output sanitization, security headers, and rate limiting in front of the API.
- **Packaging**: Dockerfile + docker-compose for app + DB; CI builds/publishes images and runs integration/E2E suites.

## Phased Work Plan

### Implementation Order
```
0 → 1 → 2 → 2.5 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 5.5 → 6 → 7 → (CI: 8 → 9 → 10)
```

### Phase 0: Pre-API Fixes ✅ (Completed)
Fixes implemented:
- Mutable state leakage in `TaskService.getDatabase()` and `ContactService.getDatabase()`:
  - Previously `Map.copyOf()` made the map unmodifiable but contained Task/Contact objects were still mutable.
  - Now returns defensive copies via `copy()` methods (matching `AppointmentService` pattern).
- Date validation edge case in `Validation.validateDateNotPast()`:
  - Previously used `date.before(new Date())` which was millisecond-sensitive.
  - Now accepts equality (date equal to "now" is valid) to avoid boundary flakiness.
- Added `copy()` methods to Task and Contact classes.
- Added tests verifying defensive copy behavior.
- All existing tests pass.

### Phase 1: Backend scaffold ✅ (Completed)
Implementation details:
- Added Spring Boot 3.4.12 parent POM with starter-web, actuator, and validation dependencies.
- Created `Application.java` Spring Boot entrypoint with `@SpringBootApplication`.
- Reorganized packages into layered architecture:
  - `contactapp.domain` - Domain entities (Contact, Task, Appointment, Validation)
  - `contactapp.service` - Services with @Service annotations (ContactService, TaskService, AppointmentService)
  - `contactapp.api` - REST controllers (populated in Phase 2)
- `contactapp.persistence` - Entities, mappers, repositories, and store abstractions backing the services (Phase 3)
- Added `@Service` annotations while preserving `getInstance()` for backward compatibility.
- Created `application.yml` with profile-based configuration (dev/test/prod).
- Locked down actuator endpoints to health/info only per OWASP guidelines.
- Added Spring Boot smoke tests:
  - `ApplicationTest` - Context load verification
  - `ActuatorEndpointsTest` - Endpoint security verification (health/info exposed, others blocked)
  - `ServiceBeanTest` - Bean presence and singleton verification
- All tests pass, 100% mutation score maintained.
- See ADR-0020 for architectural decisions.

### Phase 2: API + DTOs ✅ (Completed)
Implementation details:
- Added REST controllers: `ContactController`, `TaskController`, `AppointmentController` at `/api/v1/{resource}`.
- Created DTOs with Bean Validation:
  - `ContactRequest`/`ContactResponse` with `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, `@Pattern` for phone validation.
  - `TaskRequest`/`TaskResponse` with `@NotBlank`, `@Size` constraints.
  - `AppointmentRequest`/`AppointmentResponse` with `@FutureOrPresent` for date validation.
- DTO constraints use static imports from `Validation.MAX_*` constants to stay in sync with domain rules.
- Added `GlobalExceptionHandler` with `@RestControllerAdvice`:
  - `IllegalArgumentException` → 400 Bad Request
  - `MethodArgumentNotValidException` → 400 Bad Request (Bean Validation)
  - `ResourceNotFoundException` → 404 Not Found
  - `DuplicateResourceException` → 409 Conflict
  - `HttpMessageNotReadableException` → 400 Bad Request (malformed JSON)
- Added springdoc-openapi dependency; Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html`, OpenAPI spec at `/v3/api-docs`.
- Added 71 controller tests (30 Contact + 21 Task + 20 Appointment) covering:
  - Happy path CRUD operations
  - Bean Validation boundary tests (exact max, one-over-max)
  - 404 Not Found scenarios
  - 409 Conflict (duplicate ID)
  - Date validation (past date rejection, null date)
  - Malformed JSON handling
- All 261 tests pass, 100% mutation score maintained (159/159 killed).
- Added `GlobalExceptionHandlerTest` (4 tests initially, now 5 with `handleConstraintViolation`) for direct exception handler coverage.
- Added service lookup method tests (13 tests) covering `getAllXxx()` and `getXxxById()` methods.

### Phase 2.5: API Security Testing Foundation (Completed)
Implementation details:
- OpenAPI spec already generated via springdoc-openapi at `/v3/api-docs` and `/swagger-ui.html`.
- Added Schemathesis API fuzzing in CI via `.github/workflows/api-fuzzing.yml`:
  - Starts Spring Boot app, waits for health check, runs Schemathesis.
  - Checks: all (5xx errors, schema violations, edge cases).
  - Exports OpenAPI spec to `target/openapi/openapi.json` for ZAP and other tools.
  - Publishes JUnit XML results and fuzzing summary to GitHub Actions.
- ZAP-compatible artifacts prepared: OpenAPI spec exported as CI artifact (`openapi-spec`).
- Added `scripts/api_fuzzing.py` helper for local fuzzing runs.
- Workflow hardened (CodeRabbit review):
  - Explicit `pyyaml` installation for reliable YAML export.
  - Robust `jq`-based health check instead of fragile `grep` JSON parsing.
  - JAR file validation: verifies exactly one JAR in `target/` before startup.

### Phase 3: Persistence ✅ (Completed)
- Added dedicated persistence layer:
  - JPA entities under `contactapp.persistence.entity`.
  - Mapper components (`contactapp.persistence.mapper`) that re-use domain constructors for validation when reading DB rows.
  - Spring Data repositories plus `DomainDataStore` abstractions (`contactapp.persistence.store`) so services can swap between JPA-backed stores and legacy in-memory fallbacks.
- Services now depend on `ContactStore`/`TaskStore`/`AppointmentStore`:
  - Spring wiring injects the JPA-backed beans.
  - Legacy `getInstance()` callers automatically receive in-memory stores until the Spring bean registers, at which point data migrates into the JPA store.
- Added Flyway migrations (`db/migration/V1__create_contacts_table.sql`, `V2__create_tasks_table.sql`, `V3__create_appointments_table.sql`) mirroring constraints defined in `Validation.java`.
- Rebuilt `application.yml` as a multi-document file with dev/test/integration/prod profiles:
  - Dev/prod use Postgres (configurable via env vars).
  - Test profile uses in-memory H2 in PostgreSQL mode with Flyway enabled for schema parity.
  - Integration profile works with Testcontainers via `@ServiceConnection`.
- Expanded test suite:
  - Spring Boot service tests (H2 + Flyway) for each aggregate.
  - Legacy singleton tests ensuring `getInstance()` still works outside Spring.
  - Mapper unit tests and `@DataJpaTest` slices running Flyway migrations.
  - Testcontainers-based Postgres integration tests verifying persistence wiring and DB constraints.

### Phase 4: UI ✅ (Completed)
- Scaffolded `ui/contact-app` (React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui) with full routing for Contacts/Tasks/Appointments/Overview/Settings/Help.
- Built list + filter views, create/edit forms with React Hook Form + Zod validation mirroring `Validation.java`, delete confirmations, optimistic updates, and theme-aware layout (`AppShell`, `Sidebar`, `TopBar`).
- Added API client wrapper (`lib/api.ts`) and TanStack Query caching; Settings/Help pages document workflows; Login route added later in Phase 5 to integrate with JWT auth.
- Added component tests (Vitest/RTL, 22 tests) and Playwright CRUD smoke tests (5 tests). `frontend-maven-plugin` builds UI during `mvn package`, bundling into the Spring Boot JAR.

### Phase 5: Security + Observability ✅ (Completed)
- Added Spring Security JWT stack (AuthController, `JwtAuthenticationFilter`, `SecurityConfig`, `@PreAuthorize` usage); enforced `/api/v1/**` protection, introduced a POST `/api/v1/admin/query` override that requires CSRF tokens + `X-Admin-Override` headers + audited JSON bodies (legacy `?all=true` support remains only until **2026-02-01**), delivered `CookieCsrfTokenRepository` double-submit tokens (issued via `/api/auth/csrf-token`) so cookie-authenticated requests include `X-XSRF-TOKEN`, and ensured the CSRF cookie mirrors `SameSite=Lax`/`secure` expectations for scans.
- Added SPA auth flow: `/login` page, `RequireAuth`/`PublicOnlyRoute` guards, token/profile synchronization, selective cache clearing on logout. AuthResponse docs now mandate httpOnly cookies and CSRF safeguards.
- Added structured logging (`logback-spring.xml`), correlation IDs, fully sanitized `RequestLoggingFilter` (masked IPs, CR/LF-stripped method/URI/query/user-agent), and bucket4j/Caffeine rate limiting: login now combines username-level limits + 100/min/IP enforcement with temporary lockouts, register stays at 3/min/IP, and `/api/v1/**` remains 100/min per authenticated user.
- Enabled Prometheus metrics, secure headers (CSP/HSTS/X-Content-Type-Options/X-Frame-Options), and secrets strategy (env vars for dev/test, vault in prod). Added rate-limit, correlation, logging, and request utility tests.
- Documented credentialed CORS requirements (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, explicit SPA origins, exposed trace headers) and introduced the dedicated `app.auth.cookie.secure` property (prod profile mandates `COOKIE_SECURE`/`APP_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE`) alongside a default 30-minute `jwt.expiration` so cookie auth cannot silently fall back to insecure HTTP.

### Phase 5.5: DAST + Runtime Security ✅
- Run OWASP ZAP (API/baseline) in CI against the running test instance; fail on high/critical findings.
- Add auth/role integration tests (401/403 assertions) for protected endpoints.

### Phase 6: Packaging + CI
- Add Dockerfiles for backend and UI; compose file for app + Postgres (+ pgAdmin optional).
- Provide Makefile/task runner for local dev; publish images in CI.
- Extend CI to run unit + integration + UI tests, then build/push images while keeping existing quality gates.

### Phase 7: UX polish and backlog
- Add search/pagination/sorting for large datasets; empty states, toasts, and responsive layout.
- Harden accessibility; instrument feature usage and errors for future iterations.

## Detailed Requirements

### Backend / API
- Provide a Spring Boot runtime with a main entrypoint.
- Expose JSON REST endpoints for Contact, Task, and Appointment:
  - CRUD operations (list, get by id, create, update, delete).
  - Request/response DTOs with Bean Validation; map to domain objects.
  - Consistent JSON error envelope (e.g., `{ "message": "..." }`) for validation failures.
- Include health/info endpoints.

### Persistence
- Use Postgres for dev/prod data; use H2 and/or Postgres Testcontainers for automated tests.
- Model JPA entities aligned to Contact/Task/Appointment and wire services to repositories.
- Manage schema with Flyway migrations; keep environment-specific profiles (dev/test/prod).

### Frontend UI
- Create a React + Vite + TypeScript app under `ui/contact-app`.
- Provide pages for Contact, Task, and Appointment:
  - List with basic filtering/sorting.
  - Create/edit forms with inline validation messages.
  - Delete confirmation flow.
- Show loading and error states; handle API error messages.
- Responsive layout suitable for desktop and mobile widths.
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching and caching (per ADR-0017).

### Security
- Add authentication (JWT per ADR-0018) and protect mutating endpoints.
- Enforce role-based authorization for create/update/delete with `@PreAuthorize`.
- Configure CORS for the SPA origin and apply standard security headers.
- Apply security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options).
- Define secrets management strategy (env vars for dev; vault/secret manager for prod).

### Observability
- Add structured logging with request correlation IDs.
- Expose metrics/tracing via Spring Actuator (Micrometer) for HTTP and database calls.

### Packaging / DevOps
- Provide Dockerfiles for backend and UI; docker-compose for app + Postgres (+ optional pgAdmin).
- Externalize configuration via environment variables; document sample `.env` for local use.
- CI should run unit + integration + UI tests, build artifacts/images, and publish OpenAPI/UI outputs.

### Security Testing
- Add API fuzzing (Schemathesis or RESTler) against the OpenAPI spec; fail CI on 5xx or schema violations.
- Add DAST (OWASP ZAP baseline/API scan) in CI against a running test instance; fail on high/critical findings.
- Add auth/role integration tests asserting 401/403 for protected endpoints and success for allowed roles.
- Keep security scans documented and repeatable in CI.

### Quality / Testing
- Keep existing unit tests for domain/services.
- Add controller tests for REST endpoints and integration tests with Testcontainers.
- Add UI component tests (Vitest/RTL) and at least a smoke E2E flow (Playwright/Cypress).
- Maintain JaCoCo ≥ 80% coverage gate and keep mutation/static analysis gates in the pipeline.
- Spring Boot tests use Mockito's subclass mock-maker (`src/test/resources/mockito-extensions/org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker`) to avoid agent attach issues on newer JDKs while still enabling MockMvc/context testing.

### CI/CD Security Stages
- [x] Phase 8: ZAP baseline/API scan in CI (fail on high/critical)
- [x] Phase 9: API fuzzing in CI (fail on 5xx/schema violations)
- [ ] Phase 10: Auth/role integration tests in CI
- [x] Phase 11: Docker packaging in CI (build, health check, GHCR push)

### Quality Gates (Maintain Throughout)
- [ ] JaCoCo ≥ 80% maintained
- [ ] Mutation/static analysis gates kept in pipeline
- [ ] Controller/DTO patterns aligned across Contact/Task/Appointment

## Code Examples

### Spring Boot Entrypoint (Phase 1)
```java
// src/main/java/contactapp/Application.java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

### REST Controller + DTOs (Phase 2)
```java
// src/main/java/contactapp/api/ContactController.java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/contacts")
public class ContactController {
    private final ContactService service;
    public ContactController(ContactService service) { this.service = service; }

    @PostMapping
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    public ContactResponse create(@RequestBody @Valid ContactRequest req) {
        var contact = new Contact(req.id(), req.firstName(), req.lastName(), req.phone(), req.address());
        service.addContact(contact);
        return ContactResponse.from(contact);
    }
}

// DTOs (records keep it terse)
public record ContactRequest(String id, String firstName, String lastName, String phone, String address) {}
public record ContactResponse(String id, String firstName, String lastName, String phone, String address) {
    static ContactResponse from(Contact c) {
        return new ContactResponse(c.getContactId(), c.getFirstName(), c.getLastName(), c.getPhone(), c.getAddress());
    }
}

// Global error handler
@ControllerAdvice
class GlobalErrors {
    @ExceptionHandler(IllegalArgumentException.class)
    ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>> badRequest(IllegalArgumentException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(Map.of("message", ex.getMessage()));
    }
}
```

### API Client + TanStack Query (Phase 4)
```ts
// ui/contact-app/src/lib/api.ts — low-level fetch helpers
const base = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL ?? "http://localhost:8080/api/v1";

export async function fetchContacts(): Promise<ContactResponse[]> {
  const res = await fetch(`${base}/contacts`);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error((await res.json()).message ?? "Request failed");
  return res.json();
}

export async function createContact(payload: ContactRequest): Promise<ContactResponse> {
  const res = await fetch(`${base}/contacts`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error((await res.json()).message ?? "Request failed");
  return res.json();
}
```

```ts
// ui/contact-app/src/hooks/useContacts.ts — TanStack Query wrappers (per ADR-0017)
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { fetchContacts, createContact } from "../api";

export function useContacts() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["contacts"],
    queryFn: fetchContacts,
  });
}

export function useCreateContact() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: createContact,
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["contacts"] });
    },
  });
}
```
