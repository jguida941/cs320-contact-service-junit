Small Java project for the CS320 Contact Service milestone. The work breaks down into two pieces:
1. Build the `Contact` and `ContactService` classes exactly as described in the requirements.
2. Prove every rule with unit tests (length limits, null checks, unique IDs, and add/update/delete behavior) using the shared `Validation` helper so exceptions surface clear messages.

Everything is packaged under `contactapp`; production classes live in `src/main/java` and the JUnit tests in `src/test/java`.

## Getting Started
1. Install Java 17 and Apache Maven (3.9+).
2. Run `mvn verify` from the project root to compile everything, execute the JUnit suite, and run Checkstyle/SpotBugs/JaCoCo quality gates.
3. Open the folder in IntelliJ/VS Code if you want IDE assistance—the Maven project model is auto-detected.

## Design Decisions & Highlights
- **Immutable identifiers** - `contactId` is set once in the constructor and never mutates, which keeps HashMap keys stable and mirrors real-world record identifiers.
- **Centralized validation** - Every constructor/setter call funnels through `Validation.validateNotBlank`, `validateLength`, and (for phones) `validateNumeric10`, so IDs, names, phones, and addresses all share one enforcement pipeline.
- **Fail-fast IllegalArgumentException** - Invalid input is a caller bug, so we throw standard JDK exceptions with precise messages and assert on them in tests.
- **HashMap-first storage strategy** - Milestone 1 sticks to an in-memory `HashMap<String, Contact>` for O(1) CRUD while leaving `ContactService` as the seam for future persistence layers.
- **Security posture** - Input validation acts as the first defense layer; nothing touches storage/logs unless it passes the guards.
- **Testing depth** - Parameterized JUnit 5 tests, AssertJ assertions, JaCoCo coverage, and PITest mutation scores combine to prove the validation logic rather than just executing it.

## Architecture Overview
### Domain Layer (`Contact`)
- Minimal state (ID, first/last name, phone, address) with the `contactId` locked after construction.
- Constructor delegates to setters so validation logic fires in one place.
- Address validation uses the same length helper as IDs/names, ensuring the 30-character maximum cannot drift.

### Validation Layer (`Validation.java`)
- `validateNotBlank(input, label)` - rejects null, empty, and whitespace-only fields with label-specific messages.
- `validateLength(input, label, min, max)` - enforces 1-10 char IDs/names and 1-30 char addresses (bounds are parameters, so future changes touch one file).
- `validateNumeric10(input, label)` - requires digits-only phone numbers with exact length.
- These helpers double as both correctness logic and security filtering.

### Service Layer (`ContactService`)
- Currently a scaffold to keep milestone scope manageable. It is intended to host add/update/delete orchestration and uniqueness checks.
- By keeping this layer separate from the domain model, we can slot in persistence or caching without rewriting the entity/tests.

### Storage & Extension Points
**HashMap<String, Contact> (planned backing store)**
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------|
| add/get   | O(1)    | O(n)  | O(1)  |
| update    | O(1)    | O(n)  | O(1)  |
| delete    | O(1)    | O(n)  | O(1)  |
- This strategy meets the course requirements while documenting the upgrade path (DAO, repository pattern, etc.).

## Validation & Error Handling

### Validation Pipeline
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[input] --> B[validateNotBlank]
    B --> X[IllegalArgumentException]
    B --> C[validateLength]
    C --> X
    C --> D{phone field?}
    D --> F[field assignment]
    D --> E[validateNumeric10]
    E --> X
    E --> F
```
- IDs and names take the first two steps, addresses stop after `validateLength` (1-30 chars), and phones add the numeric guard so they remain digits-only at ten characters.
- Because the constructor routes through the setters, the exact same pipeline applies whether the object is being created or updated.

### Error Message Philosophy
```java
// Bad
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");

// Good
throw new IllegalArgumentException("firstName length must be between 1 and 10");
```
- Specific, label-driven messages make debugging easier and double as documentation. Tests assert on the message text so regressions are caught immediately.

### Exception Strategy
| Exception Type | Use Case           | Recovery? | Our Choice  |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Checked        | Recoverable issues | Maybe     | ❌          |
| Unchecked      | Programming errors | Fix code  | ✅          | 

- We throw `IllegalArgumentException` (unchecked) because invalid input is a caller bug and should crash fast.

### Propagation Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client request] --> B[ContactService]
    B --> C[Validation]
    C --> D{valid?}
    D -->|no| E[IllegalArgumentException]
    E --> F[Client handles/fails fast]
    D -->|yes| G[State assignment]
```
- Fail-fast means invalid state never reaches persistence/logs, and callers/tests can react immediately.

## Testing Strategy

### Approach & TDD
- Each validator rule started as a failing test, then the implementation was written until the suite passed.
- `ContactTest` serves as the living specification covering both the success path and every invalid scenario.

### Parameterized Coverage
- `@ParameterizedTest` + `@CsvSource` enumerate the invalid IDs, names, phones, and addresses so we don’t duplicate boilerplate tests.
```java
@ParameterizedTest
@CsvSource({
    "'', 'contactId must not be null or blank'",
    "' ', 'contactId must not be null or blank'",
    "'12345678901', 'contactId length must be between 1 and 10'"
})
void testInvalidContactId(String id, String expectedMessage) {
    assertThatThrownBy(() -> new Contact(id, "first", "last", "1234567890", "123 Main St"))
        .isInstanceOf(IllegalArgumentException.class)
        .hasMessage(expectedMessage);
}
```

### Assertion Patterns
- AssertJ’s `hasFieldOrPropertyWithValue` validates the happy path in one fluent statement.
- `assertThatThrownBy().isInstanceOf(...).hasMessage(...)` proves exactly which validation rule triggered.

### Testing Pyramid
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Static analysis] --> B[Unit tests]
    B --> C[Service tests]
    C --> D[Integration tests]
    D --> E[Mutation tests]
```
- Today the emphasis is on the base of the pyramid; upper layers (service/integration) will sit on top once persistence is added.

### Mutation Testing & Quality Gates
- PITest runs in CI with a 70% threshold on a self-hosted runner (needed for the JVM attach API). A red mutation run means the unit tests failed to catch a deliberate fault.

## Static Analysis & Quality Gates

| Layer               | Tool                       | Focus                                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Coverage            | **JaCoCo**                 | Line/branch coverage enforcement during `mvn verify`.              |
| Mutation            | **PITest**                 | Ensures assertions catch injected faults; threshold currently 70%. |
| Style & complexity  | **Checkstyle**             | Formatting, naming, and `CyclomaticComplexity` caps.               |
| Bug patterns        | **SpotBugs**               | Null dereferences, resource leaks, concurrency/perf issues.        |
| Dependency security | **OWASP Dependency-Check** | CVE scanning backed by `NVD_API_KEY` with optional skip fallback.  |
| Semantic security   | **CodeQL**                 | Detects SQLi/XSS/path-traversal patterns in a separate workflow.   |

Each layer runs automatically in CI, so local `mvn verify` mirrors the hosted pipelines.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Matrix Verification
- `.github/workflows/java-ci.yml` runs `mvn -B verify` across `{ubuntu-latest, windows-latest} × {Java 17, Java 21}` to surface OS and JDK differences early.

### Quality Gate Behavior
- Each matrix job executes the full suite (tests, JaCoCo, Checkstyle, SpotBugs, Dependency-Check, PITest).
- If Dependency-Check or PITest flakes because of environment constraints, the workflow retries with `-Ddependency-check.skip=true` or `-Dpit.skip=true` so contributors stay unblocked but warnings remain visible.

### Caching Strategy
- Maven artifacts are cached via `actions/cache@v4` (`~/.m2/repository`) to keep builds fast.
- NVD data caching will be added once the feed directory is configured, further reducing Dependency-Check warmup time.

### Mutation Lane (Self-Hosted)
- Hosted runners cannot use the JVM attach API, so a dedicated `mutation-test` job targets a self-hosted runner with `MAVEN_OPTS="--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true"`.
- This lane enforces the 70% mutation threshold that mirrors local expectations.

### Release Automation
- Successful workflows publish build artifacts, and the release workflow packages release notes so we can trace which commit delivered which binary.

## Self-Hosted Mutation Runner Setup
- Register a runner per GitHub's instructions (Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New self-hosted runner). Choose macOS/Linux + architecture.
- Install + configure:
  - Go to your repository on GitHub
  - Navigate to Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New self-hosted runner
  - Select your OS (macOS for Mac, Linux for Linux) and architecture (x64 for Intel, arm64 for Apple Silicon)
  - Follow GitHub's provided commands to download and configure the runner. 
  
  For macOS:
  ```bash
  # Create runner directory
  mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner

  # Download the latest runner package (check GitHub for exact URL as it includes version)
  # For Intel Mac:
  curl -o actions-runner-osx-x64-2.321.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.321.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.321.0.tar.gz
  # For Apple Silicon Mac:
  # curl -o actions-runner-osx-arm64-2.321.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.321.0/actions-runner-osx-arm64-2.321.0.tar.gz

  # Extract the installer
  tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-*.tar.gz

  # Configure the runner (get token from GitHub UI)
  ./config.sh --url https://github.com/jguida941/cs320-contact-service-junit --token YOUR_TOKEN_FROM_GITHUB

  # Set MAVEN_OPTS permanently (choose based on your shell)
  # For zsh (default on modern macOS):
  echo 'export MAVEN_OPTS="--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true"' >> ~/.zshrc
  source ~/.zshrc
  # For bash:
  # echo 'export MAVEN_OPTS="--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true"' >> ~/.bash_profile
  # source ~/.bash_profile

  # Start the runner
  ./run.sh
  ```
  Leave `./run.sh` running so the `mutation-test` job can execute on your machine. When you're done, press Ctrl+C to stop the runner.

## How to Use This Repository
If you're working through CS320 (or just exploring the project), the recommended flow is:
1. Read the requirements in `requirements/` so you understand the contact rules and service behavior.
2. Study `Contact.java`, `ContactService.java`, and `Validation.java` to see how the rules are enforced in code.
3. Run `mvn verify` and inspect the JUnit, JaCoCo, PITest, and dependency reports in `target/` to understand how the quality gates evaluate the project.
4. Experiment by breaking a rule on purpose, rerunning the build, and seeing which tests/gates fail, then fix the tests or code as needed.
