## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Consolidated application requirements/roadmap/checklist into `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` (phases 0–10) and `docs/ROADMAP.md` (overview).
- Phase 0 (Pre-API Fixes) captured in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`: defensive copies for Task/ContactService, date validation boundary, copy() methods for Task/Contact.
- Published ADR-0014 through ADR-0019 covering backend stack, database, API style, frontend stack, auth model, and deployment/packaging; updated ADR index accordingly.
- Added `agents.md` quick-link guide for assistants/automation to roadmap/requirements/ADRs.
- Appointment domain/service documentation and tests:
  - `docs/adrs/ADR-0012-appointment-validation-and-tests.md` and `docs/adrs/ADR-0013-appointmentservice-singleton-and-crud-tests.md`.
  - README/index updates for Appointment classes/tests and ADR index through ADR-0013.
  - Expanded README sections with validation/service mermaid diagrams and scenario coverage for appointments.
  - AppointmentService/AppointmentServiceTest implementation and coverage (singleton, add/duplicate/null, delete/blank/missing, update/trim/blank/missing, clear-all).
- README command cheat sheet plus a CI “Jobs at a Glance” table so common tasks and pipeline behavior are easy to follow without losing detail.
- Clarified README validation diagrams (trimmed text fields, phone digits-only) and documented the container verify job alongside the optional self-hosted mutation lane.
- Documented Sonatype OSS Index setup in `README.md` so dependency scans can be
  fully authenticated when desired.
- Introduced `scripts/ci_metrics_summary.py` and a GitHub Actions summary step
  so each matrix run publishes tests/coverage/mutation/dependency metrics.
- Added a "Sample QA Summary" section to `README.md` showing what the Actions
  summary table looks like for a representative run.
- Created `docs/logs/backlog.md`, moving the detailed
  backlog/sample content out of the README to keep it focused.
- Introduced `Contact#update(...)` so multi-field updates validate every value
  before committing changes, preventing partially updated contacts.
- Published the Task entity/service implementation plan in
  `docs/architecture/2025-11-19-task-entity-and-service.md` and added the ADR
  catalog (`docs/adrs/README.md`) plus ADR-0001 through ADR-0008 to capture
  validation, storage, atomic update, CI, SpotBugs runtime, documentation, Task
  feature choices, and the CI metrics summary script.
- Added `scripts/serve_quality_dashboard.py` (packaged with the `quality-reports-*`
  artifact) so contributors can spin up a local HTTP server to view the React QA dashboard.
- Added personal design notes under `docs/design-notes/notes/` (CI gates, metrics script,
  Contact entity/service behaviors, SpotBugs plan, docs structure, and test strategy) to
  capture the reasoning behind each piece of the implementation.
- Added Shields.io badges for JaCoCo line coverage, PITest mutation score, SpotBugs status,
  and Dependency-Check findings at the top of the README, plus a license badge for quick
  at-a-glance metadata.
- Updated README badges to the bolder “for-the-badge” style with GitHub/Codecov logos so the status bar matches the secure snapshot look-and-feel; static-analysis badges now use the same passing green and point to this repository.
- Checked off every item in `docs/requirements/task-requirements/requirements_checklist.md` now that the Task entity/service and tests are implemented.
- Finalized `docs/architecture/2025-11-19-task-entity-and-service.md` (status Implemented, summary, DoD results, deviations) so the Task design record reflects the delivered code.
- Dependabot Maven job now runs daily instead of weekly so dependency updates land faster.
- Bumped `org.pitest:pitest-maven` to 1.22.0 plus SpotBugs dependencies (`spotbugs-annotations` 4.9.8 and `spotbugs-maven-plugin` 4.9.8.1) to keep the QA toolchain current.
- Published ADR-0009 describing the permanent unit-test strategy (layered test classes,
  AssertJ + parameterized tests, singleton reset helpers, and CI enforcement via JaCoCo/PITest).
- Added appointment architecture/ADRs plus tightened appointment validation (trim-before-validate, not-blank guard),
  ID trimming in service adds, date validation reuse in `update`, and time-stable appointment tests (relative dates).

### Changed
- README/index/agents now link to `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/INDEX.md`.
- ADR-0018 expanded to document secrets management (env vars for dev/test; vault/secret manager for prod).
- Backlog now tracks deferred decisions (UI kit, OAuth2/SSO, WAF, prod secrets).
- Appointment is now `final`, `Appointment.copy()` validates source state and reuses the public constructor for defensive copies, and `AppointmentServiceTest` uses reflection (instead of subclassing) to simulate a blank ID so SpotBugs remains clean.
- Documented the shared `validateDateNotPast` helper across README/index/ADR/design notes and expanded `ValidationTest` with future/past-date cases so Appointment docs mirror the code.
- Appointment update/add logic now validates both fields before mutation, enforces trimmed IDs on add,
  and uses `computeIfPresent` for updates; README/architecture/design notes updated accordingly.
- AppointmentService normalizes IDs across CRUD and returns an unmodifiable snapshot of defensive copies to prevent external mutation.
- Simplified CI flow diagram labels for reliable GitHub mermaid rendering.
- Relocated the README command cheat sheet under the CI/CD section for better flow while keeping all commands visible.
- ADR-0007 (Task Entity/Service) and ADR-0009 (Test Strategy) are now marked Accepted in the ADR index and corresponding files.
- Java CI workflow now installs Python 3.12 for every matrix leg so the QA
  summary script runs reliably on Windows and Ubuntu runners.
- CodeQL workflow now pins Temurin JDK 17, caches Maven deps, enforces
  concurrency/path filters, and runs the `+security-and-quality` query pack via
  CodeQL autobuild for broader coverage.
- Java CI’s Codecov upload now reads the token from the job env to remain
  parseable for forked PRs where the `secrets` context is unavailable.
- Java CI explicitly passes `-DnvdApiKey`/delay flags to Maven verify so the
  built-in Dependency-Check execution always receives the configured secret.
- Maven Compiler now uses `<release>17</release>` via `maven.compiler.release`
  to align with the module system and eliminate repeated “system modules path”
  warnings during `javac`.
- Added `ValidationTest` to assert boundary acceptance and blank rejection in
  helper methods, giving PIT visibility into those behaviors.
- Extended `ValidationTest` with explicit null-path checks so the helper’s
  `validateNotBlank` logic triggers before length/numeric math.
- Removed redundant `validateNotBlank` calls from `Contact` so setters and the
  constructor rely solely on the shared `Validation` helpers (eliminating the
  equivalent PIT mutants and enabling a 100% mutation score).
- Contact setters now trim first/last names and addresses after validation to
  avoid persisting accidental leading/trailing whitespace.
- Contact IDs are now trimmed on construction, and `Validation.validateLength`
  measures trimmed length so validation matches the data actually stored.
- Expanded Checkstyle configuration (imports, indentation, line length, braces, etc.)
  and wired `spotbugs-maven-plugin` (auto-skipped on JDK 23+) so bug patterns fail
  `mvn verify`.
- `ContactService#getDatabase()` now returns an unmodifiable `Map.copyOf(...)`
  snapshot and a new `clearAllContacts()` helper was added for tests, eliminating
  SpotBugs exposure warnings for the service internals.
- `ContactService#updateContact` now routes through the atomic
  `Contact#update(...)` helper so updates either fully apply or leave the contact
  unchanged while reusing the constructor’s validation messages.
- Expanded service tests to cover singleton reuse, missing delete branch, and a
  last-name change during updates so mutation testing can kill the remaining
  ContactService mutants.
- Fixed the Java CI workflow so `dependency.check.skip` uses the correct
  hyphenated property, Codecov upload keys off `secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN`, and
  quality-report artifacts no longer fail the job when reports are absent.
- Updated `README.md` and `docs/index.md` to match the new `docs/requirements`
  structure and clarify when the optional self-hosted mutation lane is used.
- Scheduled Dependabot’s weekly Maven check to run Mondays at 04:00 ET so
  updates happen predictably.
- README now documents why the `release-artifacts` job is skipped on PRs and
  tracks upcoming reporting enhancements.
- Added Codecov integration (GitHub Action upload + README instructions/badge).
- Clarified README sections describing the `ConcurrentHashMap<String, Contact>`
  storage, the `Map.copyOf(...)` snapshot, and the atomic update helper managed
  by `ContactService`.
- Corrected README documentation to state that SpotBugs currently runs on supported
  JDKs (17/21) instead of implying it auto-skips on newer runtimes.
- Enhanced `scripts/ci_metrics_summary.py` to show colored icons/bars, severity
  breakdowns, and generate a dark-mode `target/site/qa-dashboard/index.html`
  page with quick links to JaCoCo/SpotBugs/Dependency-Check/PITest reports.
- React-based QA dashboard (`ui/qa-dashboard`) now builds during CI, consumes the
  generated `metrics.json`, and replaces the old static HTML so artifacts ship a
  fully interactive console.
- Added a README note explaining why the service methods return `boolean`
  (simple success/failure signaling for this milestone).
- Clarified Task test documentation (TaskTest Javadocs, README/index, and test design notes) to call out invalid update coverage and atomicity checks.
- Updated README caching section to explain that Dependency-Check caches are
  intentionally purged each run (only Maven artifacts remain cached).
- CI flow diagram now includes the QA summary/Codecov step so the visual matches
  the workflow description.
- Restructured the README’s testing section so `ContactTest` and
  `ContactServiceTest` each have their own bullet list explaining scope and
  assertions.
- Created dedicated README sections for `ContactService` validation/testing with
  TODO placeholders so the service mirrors the structure already documented for
  `Contact`.
- Added an over-length guard test in `ValidationTest` to cover the max-length branch and keep validation mutation/branch coverage at 100%.
- Clarified README headings/TOC so each section explicitly references the source
  file (`Contact.java`, `ContactTest.java`, `ContactService.java`,
  `ContactServiceTest.java`).
- Validation section now explicitly links to `Validation.java` so readers know
  which helper backs the Contact rules.
- `ContactService` validation headings now link to the source file so both
  sections mirror each other.
- Converted the Validation helper docs to describe all domain fields (Contact + Task) now that both models share the same utility.
- Added README links in each subheading so readers can jump directly to the
  relevant file (`Contact.java`, `ContactTest.java`, `ContactService.java`,
  `ContactServiceTest.java`) from the design/testing sections.
- Added explicit placeholders/doc comments in `ContactService.java` and
  `ContactServiceTest.java` so the service layer mirrors the structure of the
  `Contact`/`ContactTest` pair while we flesh out CRUD behavior.
- Completed the README sections for `Task.java`/`TaskTest.java` and `TaskService.java`/`TaskServiceTest.java`, describing validation flow, error philosophy, and scenario coverage instead of TODO placeholders.
- README now matches the implementation details: `ContactService.updateContact` references `Contact.update(...)`, `validateNumeric10` lists the `requiredLength` parameter, and SpotBugs/JDK matrix text reflects the actual `{17, 21}` CI coverage.
- Documented the new `ValidationTest.validateLengthRejectsTooLong` scenario in README to reflect full length-check coverage.
- README badges now use a uniform Shields.io flat-square style (GitHub Actions, Codecov, JaCoCo, PITest, SpotBugs, OWASP DC, License) with consistent colors (brightgreen for CI/coverage/mutation, blue for static analysis/license).
- Added `TaskServiceTest.testClearAllTasksRemovesEntries` (with a note explaining it) so PIT kills the last surviving mutant that removed the internal `Map.clear()` call.
- Captured the Contact/Task invalid-update atomicity tests in the README scenario coverage lists so users can see those guardrails.
- `ContactService#updateContact` and `TaskService#updateTask` now validate/trim
  the incoming ids (matching the delete paths) so lookups succeed even if
  callers include whitespace, and both services now throw `IllegalArgumentException`
  for blank ids on update; new unit tests cover the trimmed-id success path and
  blank-id error case.
- Expanded `TaskTest.invalidUpdateInputs` with empty-string and null cases to mirror constructor/setter validation, and clarified README Dependency-Check defaults (3500ms with an API key, 8000ms without).
- Refreshed `README.md` and `index.md` to correct Task file paths (now under
  `contactapp`), link to the new architecture/ADR directories, and fix stale
  relative links left over from the original docs layout.
- Updated `ui/qa-dashboard` to emit relative asset paths, fixed report links,
  and documented the new `serve_quality_dashboard.py` helper so the downloaded
  dashboard renders correctly when opened locally or via the bundled server.
- Extended `scripts/ci_metrics_summary.py` so Dependency-Check uses the shared
  `target/` constant, PITest "detected" counts flow into summaries, and the QA
  report now includes a dependency severity breakdown row plus ADR tracking.
- Enhanced `scripts/ci_metrics_summary.py` to optionally write badge JSON for JaCoCo,
  PITest, SpotBugs, and Dependency-Check when `UPDATE_BADGES=true`, so badges stay in sync.

### Security
- Bumped `org.pitest:pitest-maven` to `1.21.1` and `org.pitest:pitest-junit5-plugin`
  to `1.2.3` for the latest mutation-testing fixes.
- Upgraded `org.owasp:dependency-check-maven` to `12.1.9` for the most recent
  CVE feed handling improvements.
